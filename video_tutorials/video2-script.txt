Video2 - The stage

This video will focus on the stage located on the right side. The stage contains an arrow shaped figure, called the sprite. This sprite essentially can be controlled by blocks of code that you put together on the scripting area which is located on the left side of the stage. The sprite can act as an object that you control with your blocks of code. This means that the sprite responds to the actions that the blocks of code perform. If you right click on the stage one of the important option that youâ€™re given is called pic - like in picture. With this option you can take a screenshot of your stage and open that picture in a new tab so that you can save it. As mentioned in the previous video about the toolbar, you can change the size of the stage by clicking the associated buttons right above the left area of the stage. If you are presenting the stage, there is a mode called presentation mode which allows you to enter full screen.

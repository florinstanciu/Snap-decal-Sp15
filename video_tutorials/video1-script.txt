Video1 - The tool bar

The topmost bar is called the toolbar and it has a variety of buttons. On the right side of the toolbar there are three buttons-- the green flag, the yellow pause, and the red stop button. These three buttons allow you to start, pause, and stop your program from running. The middle of the toolbar allows you to control the size of the white stage on the right side of the window. This stage can be resized and placed into presentation mode with these two buttons respectively. 

On the left side now, there are a variety of logistical tools. Starting from the leftmost button we have one that looks like a sheet of paper-- Â over here you can manage your files. A few of the more important options are creating a new file, opening a pre-existing file, saving a new created file, importing blocks, and importing tools. The button adjacent to the paper button, which looks like a cloud, allows you to manage your SNAP! account by letting you log into it. Here you can also reset your password if you forget it. The next button which looks like a wheel is the settings tool. A few important options are changing the language, changing the stage size, and enabling turbo mode so that your code runs faster at the caost of not updating your display as frequently.

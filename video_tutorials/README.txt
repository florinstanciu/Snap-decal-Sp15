This project is a tutorial that explains the components of Snap!
This is not meant to teach how to program in Snap! 

When learning how to use a web application like the SNAP! language or learning how to use Photoshop--the best way to begin is by understand what tools you have at hand so that you can in the near future complete any tasks given to you efficiently.
